# Day-by-Day Execution Plan

Each day answers four questions:

1. What business problem are we solving?  
2. What are you expected to do?  
3. What does success look like for the business?  
4. How will learning be evaluated?

## Day 1 – Access, Roles, and Ownership

### Business Problem

The business does not trust the platform because **access and ownership are unclear**.

**Business question:**  
**“Who owns the data, and who is allowed to use it?”**

### What You Are Expected to Do

- Design role-based access aligned to responsibilities  
- Separate ingestion, transformation, and analytics access  
- Avoid using default admin roles  
- Assign ownership intentionally  

### Expected Outcome (Business View)

- Clear ownership of data layers  
- Minimal and intentional access  
- Reduced risk before analytics begins  

### Evaluation Focus

- Can you explain why access separation matters?  
- Do your roles reflect business responsibilities?  

### Quiz / Reflection (Mandatory)

## Day 2 – Raw Data and Ingestion

### Business Problem

The business cannot trace where data came from or recover from failures.

**Business question:**  
**“Can we trust raw data and trace it back to the source?”**

### What You Are Expected to Do

- Load structured and semi-structured data as-is  
- Preserve file metadata  
- Keep raw data unchanged  
- Design for reprocessing  

### Expected Outcome (Business View)

- Raw data can be audited  
- Errors can be investigated  
- Pipelines can be re-run safely  

### Evaluation Focus

- Do you understand why raw data should remain untouched?  
- Can you explain auditability in simple terms?

## Day 3 – Transformations and Data Quality

### Business Problem

Teams calculate metrics differently and do not trust each other’s data.

**Business question:**  
**“Can we create consistent meaning from messy data?”**

### What You Are Expected to Do

- Identify data quality issues  
- Clean and standardize where required  
- Apply simple, consistent business rules  
- Decide what *not* to fix  

### Expected Outcome (Business View)

- Metrics mean the same across teams  
- Analysts spend less time cleaning data  
- Event data becomes usable  

### Evaluation Focus

- Can you justify your transformation decisions?  
- Do you understand trade-offs in data cleaning?

## Day 4 – Analytics, Performance, and Compute

### Business Problem

Insights are slow and compute costs are unclear.

**Business question:**  
**“Can leaders get answers quickly without overspending?”**

### What You Are Expected to Do

- Build analytics-ready datasets  
- Choose warehouse sizes consciously  
- Observe performance differences  
- Think about cost vs value  

### Expected Outcome (Business View)

- Faster insights  
- Predictable performance  
- Controlled compute usage  

### Evaluation Focus

- Do you understand why warehouse size matters?  
- Can you explain compute decisions in business terms?

## Day 5 – Data Sharing, Governance, and Delivery

### Business Problem

The business needs to share analytics data with partners safely and at scale.

**Business question:**  
**“Can we share trusted data without copying or manual work?”**

### What You Are Expected to Do

- Create a secure data share  
- Share only analytics-ready data  
- Configure future grants  
- Prevent exposure of raw or sensitive data  

### Expected Outcome (Business View)

- Partners access trusted data directly  
- New analytics tables are shared automatically  
- Governance scales with growth  

### Evaluation Focus

- Do you understand why data sharing is better than exports?  
- Can you explain future grants clearly?

# Final Project Evaluation

You will be evaluated on:

| Area | Focus |
|-----|------|
| Business understanding | Why decisions were made |
| Fundamentals | Raw → Transform → Analytics |
| Governance awareness | Access, security, sharing |
